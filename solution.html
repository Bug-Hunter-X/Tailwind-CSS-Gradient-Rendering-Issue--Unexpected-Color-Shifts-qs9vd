```html
<div style="background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #5656ff, #a556ff); padding: 4px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This solution uses inline styles with a fully specified `linear-gradient` to bypass any potential interference from other CSS rules or Tailwind's utility classes. This approach offers more control over the gradient's appearance and ensures consistent rendering across different browsers.
