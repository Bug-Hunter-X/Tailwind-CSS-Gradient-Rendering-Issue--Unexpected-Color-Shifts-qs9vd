# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Tailwind CSS gradients. Under specific circumstances, the gradient may not render as expected, exhibiting unexpected color shifts or direction changes.

## Problem Description

The core problem lies in the interaction between Tailwind's gradient utility classes and other CSS rules or browser-specific rendering behavior. In some cases, the gradient may appear distorted or the colors may shift unexpectedly, deviating from the intended appearance.

## Solution

The solution often involves careful review of conflicting CSS rules and using more explicit gradient specifications.  This might include overriding conflicting styles or defining gradients with more precise color stops and directions.  In some cases, using a different gradient method or a fallback CSS gradient might be necessary.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior of the gradient.
4. Refer to `solution.html` for a potential solution.
