```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  The issue arises when using very specific color combinations or when the gradient direction is unexpectedly altered by other CSS rules.
